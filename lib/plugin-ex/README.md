# Circuit Bot Example Plugin

This plugin shows some examples how the Plugin-"API" works.

It demonstrates the usage of

 - the `wakeup` filter
 - the `wakeup_advanced` filter, sending replies to an item configured in $config['parent_id'].
 - the `wakeup_advanced` filter in combination with the `parent_id` action.

 Take a look at the source in `index.php` to learn more.
